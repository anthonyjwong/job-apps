Here is the rewritten commit message in Conventional Commits format:

`refactor: scraper and backend improvements`

Body:
```
Refactored Ashby scraper to wait for manual approval before submitting application. Improved submission process by introducing human delays and checking for success or failure containers.

Updated scrape.py, src/apply.py, src/definitions.py, utils.py, main.py, scrapers/sites/ashby.py
```
