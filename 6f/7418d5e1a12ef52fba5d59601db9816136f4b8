Here is the rewritten commit message in Conventional Commits format:

`feat: add support for manual application creation`

Body:
```markdown
Added endpoints and UI to create applications manually.
This includes two ways of creating a new application:
1. By providing a `job_id` or
2. By providing a minimal job payload.

The application is then saved to the database with the newly created job, if applicable.
```
Note that I've kept the body concise while still conveying the main changes made in this commit.
