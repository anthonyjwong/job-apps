Here is the rewritten commit message in Conventional Commits format:

`remove hardcoded db env vars`

Remove hardcoded DB environment variables from database.py and docker-compose.dev.yml, replacing with references to environment variables. Also update crud.py to use correct date_posted parsing.

Note that I've kept the subject line â‰¤ 72 characters as required by the Conventional Commits format.
