```
feat: add multiple pages to frontend

Implement a new TODO page, update backend/src/definitions.py to convert id fields to strings, and create two new pages:
- An approval page for listing saved applications
- A job listings page for listing all saved jobs

The TODO page includes a list of tasks for implementing these features.

Note that this is the first step in completing these features. Further development will be required to fully implement them.
```
