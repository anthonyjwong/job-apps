Here is the rewritten commit message in Conventional Commits format:

```
feat: add application state update functionality

update_application_state_by_id added to db/utils.py
new endpoint /app/{app_id}/state created in backend/main.py
frontend app/page.tsx updated to handle new API call
```

Note that I used the `feat` type, which indicates a new feature has been added. The commit message is concise and follows the rules specified:

* Subject â‰¤ 72 characters, imperative mood, no trailing period, all lowercase.
* Body provides a brief description of the changes made.
