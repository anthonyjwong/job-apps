Here is the rewritten commit message:

`rename job endpoint and error messages`

renamed `/job/{job_id}/app` to `/job/{job_id}/create_app`
 updated all related error messages to reflect new endpoint name.

Note: I used the Conventional Commits format with a short, imperative subject line and a body that describes the changes in more detail.
