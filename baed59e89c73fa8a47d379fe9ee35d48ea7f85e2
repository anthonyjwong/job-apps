Here is the rewritten commit message in Conventional Commits format:

```
fix: migrate scraper logic to async/await syntax

async/await was used for blocking operations, but not other parts of the code.
This change ensures consistent use of async/await and eliminates potential
blocking issues on Python 3.7 and later.

Added new endpoint "/jobs" to list all saved job applications.
