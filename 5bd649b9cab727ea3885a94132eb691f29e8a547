Here is the rewritten commit message:

fix(main.py): remove unused logging statement
remove unnecessary timeout from LinkedIn scraper

Note: I assumed that the changes were made to a file named "main.py" in the backend directory. If this is not correct, please provide more information about the files involved and I will rewrite the commit message accordingly.
