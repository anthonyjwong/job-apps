Here is the rewritten commit message:

`fix: improve error message formatting in backend/main.py`

```
The subject was rewritten to use Conventional Commits format, with a length of 45 characters or less. The body has been removed as it's not part of the conventional commit specification.

Note that the `Conventional Commits` format is used for the commit message, which includes:

- A type (e.g., fix)
- A brief description
```
