# Frontend Architecture & API Guide

This folder documents the conventions, patterns, and API contracts used by the frontend. It supersedes REFACTOR.md and is designed for quick onboarding of engineers and LLMs.

- Start here: server-first patterns and islands — see `patterns.md`.
- Mutations: server actions, revalidation — see `server-actions.md`.
- Types and serialization boundaries — see `types-and-boundaries.md`.
- Endpoint reference (requests/responses, examples) — see `endpoints/index.md` and per-endpoint files.
