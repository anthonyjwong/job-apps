Here is the rewritten commit message in Conventional Commits format:

`feat(db): allow nullable location column`

The changes include:
- A new file `backend/alembic/versions/d710a8134fb6_.py` containing Alembic migration code for changing the `location` column to be nullable.
- Modifications to `backend/db/crud.py`, `backend/db/models.py`, and `backend/src/definitions.py` to reflect the changes in the database schema.
- Updates to `docker-compose.dev.yml` to map container ports correctly.

Note that I've kept the subject line short and in imperative mood, as required by Conventional Commits.
