Here is the rewritten commit message in **Conventional Commits** format:

```
fix: update requirements.txt with new dependencies and versions
```

Body (optional, but since there were many changes, I included a brief description):

```
update backend/requirements.txt to include latest versions of dependencies, including Django 4.2.18, Pydantic 2.10.4, and others. Also removed unnecessary packages.
```
