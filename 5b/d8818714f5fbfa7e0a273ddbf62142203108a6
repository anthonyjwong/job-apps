Here is the rewritten commit message in Conventional Commits format:

```
feat: add README.md with project details and tech stack

This file provides an overview of the project's purpose, motivation, and technical components. It also includes setup instructions and API documentation.

The README now includes information on:
- Project goal and motivation
- Tech stack (backend, frontend, orchestration)
- Environment variables
- Quick start guide with Docker Compose
- Common workflows

This update will help new contributors understand the project's context and get started more easily.
```

Note that I've kept the subject line concise (â‰¤ 72 chars) and in imperative mood.
