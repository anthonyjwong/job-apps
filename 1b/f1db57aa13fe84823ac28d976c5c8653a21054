Here is the rewritten commit message in Conventional Commits format:

```
remove unnecessary time.sleep() calls and introduce human_delay()

The human_delay function introduces delays in a more consistent way than
time.sleep(). It also allows for easier debugging by allowing delays to be
emulated.
```
